# 1. Download the data file "digsym_clean.csv" from the moodle and save it in your 
# working directory. 

setwd('C:/Users/RA/Desktop/Romeo_Doc/UNI_MASTER/WS19_20/Statistik_mit_R')
# 2. Read in the data into a variable called "data".

data <- read.csv('digsym_clean.csv')
data
# 3. Get rid of the column "X"
data$X <- NULL
data

# Say you're interested in whether people respond with different accuracy to 
# right vs. wrong picture-symbol combinations.
# In other words, you want to compare the average accuracy for the digsym-right 
# and digsym-wrong condition.
# Like the conscientious researcher you are, you want to take a look at the data 
# before you get into the stats.
# Therefore, you will need to create a barplot of the mean accuracy data 
# (split out by condition) using ggplot and the summarySE function (given below).
# Let's do it step by step.

summarySE <- function(data=NULL, measurevar, groupvars=NULL, na.rm=FALSE, conf.interval=.95) {
  # data: an input dataframe
  # measurevar: a column name of <data> (as string), on which we would like to calculate 
  #             standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) and confidence interval (CI).
  # groupvars: categorical columns of <data> (as vector of strings ) which we would like to use
  #            to make all possible combinations for which we calculate SD, SE, CI based 
  #            on <measurevar>.
  # na.rm: should we remove NA
  # conf.interval: confidence interval
  library(doBy)
  
  length2 <- function (x, na.rm=FALSE) {
    if (na.rm) sum(!is.na(x))
    else       length(x)
  }
  
  # Collapse the data
  formula <- as.formula(paste(measurevar, paste(groupvars, collapse=" + "), sep=" ~ "))
  
  datac <- summaryBy(formula, data=data, FUN=c(length2,mean,sd), na.rm=na.rm)
  
  # Rename columns
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".mean",    sep="") ] <- measurevar
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".sd",      sep="") ] <- "sd"
  names(datac)[ names(datac) == paste(measurevar, ".length2", sep="") ] <- "N"
  
  # Calculate standard error of the mean
  datac$se <- datac$sd / sqrt(datac$N)  
  
  # Confidence interval multiplier for standar
  # Calculate t-statistic for confidence interval: 
  # e.g., if conf.interval is .95, use .975 (above/below), and use df=N-1
  ciMult <- qt(conf.interval/2 + .5, datac$N-1)
  datac$ci <- datac$se * ciMult
  
  return(datac)
}

# 4. Apply the function summarySE on the accuracy data grouping by right/wrong condition
# (use the provided documentation inside the function above for the arguments description).


data_SE <- summarySE(data, 'accuracy',data$condition,na.rm=FALSE, conf.interval=.95)
data_SE


  #geom_errorbar(aes(x=condition, ymin=accuracy-data_SE$se, ymax=accuracy+data_SE$se), width=.2, position=position_dodge(.9))
# 5. Create the barplot (use ggplot2 for this and all tasks below) with error bars 
# (which the function summarySE readily provided).
# Gauging from the plot, does it look like there's a huge difference in accuracy 
# for responses to the right and wrong condition?
library(ggplot2)

wrong_con_data <- data %>% filter(condition == 'wrong')
right_con_data <- data %>% filter(condition == 'right')
right_SE <- summarySE(right_con_data, 'accuracy', data$condition)
wrong_SE <- summarySE(wrong_con_data, 'accuracy', data$condition)
accuracy_mean <- c(right_SE$accuracy,right_SE$accuracy)
accu_mean_data <- data.frame(accuracy_mean)
accu_mean_data$condition <- c('right','wrong')
accu_mean_data$sd <- c(right_SE$sd,wrong_SE$sd)
ggplot(accu_mean_data, aes(x= accu_mean_data$condition, y = accu_mean_data$accuracy_mean)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=accu_mean_data$accuracy_mean -accu_mean_data$sd, ymax=accu_mean_data$accuracy_mean + accu_mean_data$sd))


## No there is not a huge difference in accuracy for the reponses to the right and wrong condition

# 6. Let's go back to our data frame "data", which is still loaded in your console
# Now that you've taken a look at the data, you want to get into the stats.
# You want to compute a t-test for the average accuracy data in the right and 
# wrong condition.
# Why can't you compute a t-test on the data as they are now? 
# Hint: Which assumption is violated?




# The assumption that standard deviation is the same in both groups is violated here or also
# The Independence assumption of t-test which assumes that the observations in your data set 
# are not correlated with each other, or related to each other.
# So this assumption is violated in our data now. we have to reshape the data.

# We are not realy sure of our answers. a feedback will be great.


# 7. We need to reshape the data to only one observation (average accuracy) per subject 
# and right/wrong condition. Here we will use cast() which we discussed in the tutorial
# for sheet 2. 
# Collapse the data, 
# using cast(data, var1 + var2 + var3 ... ~, function, value = var4, na.rm = T).
# Store the result in a new variable called "cdata". 
## Check ?cast or https://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html for more infos on 
## cast(). 
library(reshape)

Cdata <-cast(data, Subject + condition ~ ., fun.aggregate = mean, value = "accuracy", na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(Cdata)[colnames(Cdata)=="(all)"] <- "average"
Cdata

# 8. Create histograms of the accuracy data depending on the right and wrong 
# condition and display them side by side.

ggplot(data=Cdata, aes(x=average, fill=condition)) + 
  geom_histogram(position="dodge") + 
  labs(title="Histogram for average accuracy")



# 9. Display the same data in density plots. 

ggplot(data=Cdata, aes(x=average, color=condition)) + 
  geom_density(position="dodge") + 
  labs(title="Histogram for average accuracy")


# 10. Based on the histograms and the density plots - are these data normally 
# distibuted?

#The data are normally distributed (though not perfect) with a negative skew

# 11. Create boxplots of the accuracy data.

ggplot(data=Cdata, aes(x=condition, y=average)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position="dodge") + 
  labs(title="Histogram for average accuracy")

# Feedback hier will be great.

# 12. Compute the t-test to compare the mean accuracy between wrong and right picture
# combinations.
# Do you need a paired t-test or independent sample t-test? why?

# We need paired t -tests because the data is same for the subjects 
t.test(Cdata$average ~ Cdata$condition, paired = TRUE)

# 13. What does the output tell you? What conclusions do you draw?

#t = 3.7691, df = 36, p-value = 0.000588
#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
#95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.01303888 0.04341757
#sample estimates:
#  mean of the differences 
#0.02822823
#the p value is < 0.05 and hence , we reject the null hypothesis. There is some corelation/dependence between average accuracy and conditions

# 14. Compute the effect size using CohensD.

cohensD(reshaped$average ~ reshaped$condition,method="paired")

# 15. Which effect size do we get? How do you interpret this result?
# we get 0.6196291
# the effect is medium and  the mean=0.6 times the standard deviation

# 16. In addition to the long-format data we've just been working on, you may also 
# encounter data sets in a wide format (this is the format we have been using in 
# class examples.)
# Let's do a transformation of our data set (cdata) to see what it would look like in a wide 
# format.
# Use spread() from the tidyr package.

library(tidyr)
wideformat<-spread(Cdata,key=condition,value=average)
wideformat

# 17. Compute the t-test again on the wide format data - note that for wide-format 
# data you need to use a different annotation for the t-test.

t.test(wideformat$right,wideformat$wrong, paired = TRUE)

#    Paired t-test

#data:  wideformat$right and wideformat$wrong
#t = 3.7691, df = 36, p-value = 0.000588
#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
#95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.01303888 0.04341757
#sample estimates:
#  mean of the differences 
#0.02822823


# 18. Compare the t-test results from the wide-format and the long-format data. 
# What do you notice?

# we get the same results

# 19. Compute CohensD on the wide format data. What do you notice?
cohensD(wideformat$right,wideformat$wrong,method="paired")


# 20. Let's try the t-test again, but for a different question:
# Suppose you are interested in whether reaction times in the digit symbol 
# task differ depending on gender.
# In other words, you want to test whether or not men perform significantly 
# faster on average than women, or vice versa.
# Collapse the original data, using 
# cast(data, var1 + var2 + var3 ... ~ ., function, value = var4, na.rm = T).
# Store the result in a new variable called "cdat"


cdat <- cast(data, StimulDS1.CRESP + Gender ~ ., fun.aggregate = mean, value = "correct_RT", na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(cdat)[colnames(cdat)=="(all)"] <- "average"


# 21. Take a look at cdat using head().

head(cdat)
# 22. Compute the t-test to compare the accuracy means of female and male 
# participants.
# Which t-test do you need and why? How do you interpret the result?

# We need independent t tests 
#because the response time is being compared between two different sets of people (classified based on gender)
t.test(cdat$average ~ cdat$Gender, paired = FALSE)
# p-value = 0.209 , this value is greater than 0.05
# Null hypothesis cannot be rejected because there is no dependency/correlation 
# between Reaction times for the different subsets (classified based on gender)
